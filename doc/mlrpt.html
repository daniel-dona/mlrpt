Introduction</b></a><br>
mlrpt is a non-interactive command-line version of glrpt, an
integrated application for Receiving, Decoding and Saving LRPT
Images from the Russian Meteor-M type of Weather Satellites. mlrpt
supports reception through the now very popular RTL-SDR receiver
dongles, available cheaply from many sources. As of version 1.2,
mlrpt supports reception with the Airspy R2 and Mini SDR
receivers.</p>
<p><a name="Use" id="Use"></a></p>
<pre>

<a name="Features" id="Features"><b>2. Features</b></a><br>
mlrpt can decode images in real time as they are received from the
Satellite and save them to disk, after some optional image
processing. The APID channel images and the combined color image
are stored in its working directory /home/user/mlrpt/images/ and
are saved either in the PGM (Portable Grey Map) format or JPEG
format. As of version 1.2, mlrpt can save images without image
processing in addition to processed images, if enabled in the
mlrpt's configuration file.
<p><a name="Config" id="Config"><b>Per-Satellite configuration
files</b></a><br>
With the arrival of a new Meteor-M2 satellite, it is now necessary
to have separate configuration files for different satellites.
mlrpt now requires one default configuration file and one such for
each satellite of interest. The default file may be a link to one
of the satellite-specific files. The required configuration file is
specified by the -c command line option: mlrpt
-c&lt;config-file-name&gt;. Configuration files are assumed to be
in mlrpt's working directory and only the file name need be
supplied: mlrpt -c Meteor_M2-2.cfg will cause mlrpt to look for a
configuration file named Meteor_M2-2.cfg in
/home/&lt;user-dir&gt;/mlrpt/ and use this to configure itself for
that satellite.<br>
It is necessary for at least one default configuration file to be
present in mlrpt's working directory, named default.cfg. This can
be a link to a preferred satellite's configuration file.</p>
<p><a name="SDR-Setup" id="SDR-Setup"><b>SDR Receiver
set-up</b></a><br>
mlrpt automatically sets up the SDR Receiver, specified in the
configuration file, for the required parameters (Center Frequency,
Sampling Rate, Butterworth LPF cut-off etc) for correct
operation.</p>
<p><a name="Normalize" id="Normalize"><b>Normalization of
images</b></a><br>
mlrpt performs simple (linear) Histogram Normalization of the LRPT
images to enhance Contrast and Luminance range. If normalization is
not desired, it can be disabled in the
/home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration file.</p>
<p><a name="Clahe" id="Clahe"><b>C.L.A.H.E.:</b></a><br>
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization algorithm by Karel
Zuiderveld, from "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994, Computer
Vision Research Group, Utrecht, The Netherlands. This provides
excellent regional Enhancement of Contrast, but it has to follow my
own simple Histogram Normalization function because this is set up
to ignore the occasional black stripes that Meteor-M2 seems to
transmit in the images.If CLAHE equalization is not desired, it can
be disabled in the /home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt;
configuration file.</p>
<p><a name="Rectify" id="Rectify"><b>Rectification of Tangential
Distortion:</b></a><br>
Rich Griffiths W2RG has contributed code to rectify the Geometric
distortion present in raw images of Meteor-M satellites. This
distortion is caused by the ever increasing physical length of
image pixels due to the geometry of the satellite's scanners
(tangential distortion). The Earth's curvature also contributes to
this distortion and now mlrpt has built-in code to correct this
deficiency.</p>
<p>Since version 1.7, I have added my own take on rectifying
Meteor-M raw images. The code is similar to W2RG's code, except
that the creation of added pixels, needed to "stretch" the image,
is done by linear interpolation rather than filling gaps between
pixels of the rectified image. Either one of the rectification
functions (or none) can be specified in the configuration files or
by a command line option.</p>
<p><a name="Colorize" id="Colorize"><b>Pseudo-colorization of
images</b></a><br>
mlrpt can enhance the colorization of the combined pseudo-color
image by detecting watery areas in a specified APID image and
enhancing the blue RGB channel. It can also enhance cloud cover by
detecting bright areas in the blue channel image and equalizing the
RGB channels. If colorization is not desired, it can be disabled in
the /home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration file.</p>
<p><a name="Invert" id="Invert"><b>Inversion (flipping) of
images</b></a><br>
mlrpt can perform 180 degree Rotation (Flip)) of the APT images if
the -i command line option is given. This is useful for righting
the inverted images produced by the South-to-North passes of the
satellites.</p>
<p><a name="QuickStart" id="QuickStart"><b>3.Quick
Start</b></a><br>
First navigate (cd) to the directory you have downloaded mlrpt.
Usually this will be Downloads/ in your home directory.</p>
<pre>
cd ~/Downloads/
tar jxvf mlrpt-*.*.tar.bz2 
cd mlrpt-*.*
./autogen.sh 
./configure 
make
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>This should install the "mlrpt" binary in /usr/local/bin. The
mlrpt's documentation will be installed in
/usr/local/share/doc/mlrpt/ and its working directory in
/usr/local/share/examples/mlrpt. The user should then create
mlrpt's working directory /home/&lt;user-dir&gt;/mlrpt/ and copy
the files in /usr/local/share/examples/mlrpt/ to this directory. If
all goes well, you should be able to start mlrpt just by typing
mlrpt, without any command line options, in the console. For quiet
operation, start with mlrpt -q. To quit mlrpt and save any images
that were received (to /home/user/images), type Ctrl-C (user
interrupt) in the console. Otherwise mlrpt will terminate when its
internal timer has completed. Default timeout is specified in the
~/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration file.</p>
<p>While mlrpt will work with its default configuration, it can now
be directed to use a satellite-specific configuration file by using
the -c command line option, e.g. mlrpt -c M2-1.cfg will direct
mlrpt to use Meteor-M2-1's specific configuration file. The user
will need to go through the configuration files and edit the
settings according to each satellite's parameters, mainly the LRPT
Transmitter frequency, the Symbol Rate and the Image Channels
currently in use.</p>
<p>Other settings that might need editing is the Synthesizer
Frequency Error correction factor where you should enter your SDR
Receiver's synthesizer error. If in doubt, just leave it as is (0).
Also the Duration in seconds of the image decoding operation, the
default of 900sec (15min) may be too long when using fixed antennas
like QFHA or turnstiles. However, this will not affect successful
reception of images.</p>
<p><a name="Compilation" id="Compilation"><b>4.
Compilation</b></a><br>
Please note that I use <a href="http://www.voidlinux.org">Void
Linux AMD64</a> which is a "bleeding edge" type distribution, so
there may be compilation and/or run time difficulties if you are
using a relatively old distro. This is mostly true of the basic
dependencies like the SDR API development libraries
(librtlsdr-devel and lib airspy-devel).</p>
<p>To compile the package, it may be preferable to first run the
included "autogen.sh" script in the package's top directory, to
produce a fresh build environment. Then the "configure" script can
be run with optional parameters to override the default settings
and compiler flags, e.g: ./configure --prefix=/usr CFLAGS="-g -O2"
will override the default /usr/local installation prefix and the
"-Wall -O2" compiler flags.</p>
<p>Running "make" in the package's top directory should produce the
executable binary in src/. Running "make install" will install the
binary into /usr/local/bin by default or under the specified
prefix. It will also install the mlrpt working directory and
default configuration file into the user's home directory. This
will have to be edited by the user as required. There is also this
hypertext documentation file which you can copy to a location of
your choice.</p>
<p><a name="Usage" id="Usage"><b>5. Usage and command line

<p><a name="Operation" id="Operation"><b>6. Operation</b></a><br>
<b>Setting up working directories:</b><br>
Before mlrpt is used to receive images, it is important to
understand how the resulting image files are named and saved: mlrpt
generates file names based on the channel number and the current
date and time and stores image files in its
/home/&lt;user-dir&gt;/mlrpt/images/ directory. The image file
names are created from a base string of the format ddMonyyyy-hhmm
where dd is the day number, Mon is the month name, yyyy is the year
and hhmm the current time (UTC) in hours and minutes. To this, the
LRPT image channel number is appended and then the extension .jpg
or .pgm or .ppm is also appended, e.g. 05Sep2018-0728-Ch0.pgm is a
Channel 0 image file that was saved on September 5 2018 at 0728
UTC.</p>
Before running mlrpt, it may be necessary to customize some entries
in the /home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration text
files in your home directory. These are the items that may need
editing:
<ul>
<li>The choice of the SDR Receiver. mlrpt currently supports the
popular RTL-SDR receivers and the Airspy R2 and Mini SDR
receivers.</li>
<li>The SDR Device Index. Default is 0 (use first SDR device) and
maximum value is 8 for data sanity checking.</li>
<li>The I/Q Sample Rate Samples/s. The default is 288000 for the
RTL-SDR and preferably should not be changed. For the Airspy R2 the
usable sample rate is 2500000 S/s and for the Mini 3000000
S/s.</li>
<li>Low Pass Filter Bandwidth. This should be at least 100kHz and
less than the SDR Sample Rate. Default is 150kHz</li>
<li>The Manual Gain setting for the SDR receivers. This is in the
range 0-100% and default is 90%. A value of 0 will result in
Automatic Gain Control to be selected.</li>
<li>The Synthesizer Frequency Error correction factor (default is
0). This is in Parts per Million (ppm). This is one item worth
specifying because it helps the PLL lock on the satellite signal a
little easier.</li>
<li>The Satellite's Carrier Frequency in kHz. Default is 137900kHz
for the Meteor-M2-1.</li>
<li>Duration in seconds of image decoding operation (default 900).
This is usually to long (15 min) unless a high gain rotating
directional antenna is used. This value can be changed here or</li>
<li>The Satellite's Symbol Rate. Default is 72000 for the
Meteor-M2-1.</li>
<li>The duration in sec of the image Receiving and Decoding
Operation. The default is 900 sec but it is usually too long (15
min) unless a rotatable beam antenna is used. Normally about
400-600 sec is reasonable. This can also be specified with the -t
option but in minutes.</li>
<li>The RRC (Raised Root Cosine) Filter Order. Default is 32. A
value of 64 may be used with high powered computers.</li>
<li>The RRC Filter alpha factor. Default is 0.6 and should not
normally be changed.</li>
<li>Initial Costas PLL Loop Bandwidth in Hz. Default is 100.</li>
<li>Costas PLL In-Lock Phase Error Threshold. Below this the PLL
will be in Locked mode. The PLL Unlocked Threshold will be set at
+5% above this. The actual value will depend on Receiver noise
levels and antenna performance. It should be selected so that the
PLL Locked indication should just be off with no signal. Default is
0.80</li>
<li>Modulation Mode: 1 = QPSK (M2-2) 2 = DOQPSK (M2-2 72k) 3 =
IDOQPSK (M2-2 80k)</li>
<li>Symbol Rate of the QPSK Transmission in Sy/s. Default is 72000
for Meteor M2.</li>
<li>Demodulator Interpolation factor. Default is 4 and need not be
changed.</li>
<li>Decoded Image Output Mode:<br>
1 = Output a combined APID channels pseudo-colorized image.<br>
2 = Output individual monochrome images of APID channels.<br>
3 = Output both Combined and Channel Images.<br></li>
<li>File type for saving monochrome channel (APID) images ONLY! 1 =
Save as jpeg. 2 = Save as PGM file. 3 = Save as both.</li>
<li>JPEG compression quality factor (percent). Default is 85 %</li>
<li>Enable saving of Raw (unprocessed) Images as well. Default is 0
(no).</li>
<li>Image Histogram Normalization (stretches the image luminance to
the full 0-255 value range). 0 = no, 1 = yes. Default is 1.</li>
<li>C.L.A.H.E. (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization).
Provides excellent Regional Contrast Enhancement. 0 = no, 1 = yes.
The Image Normalization option above must also be enabled for this
to have effect. Default is 1.</li>
<li>Rectification of the geometric distortion present in raw Meteor
images.<br>
0 = None, 1 = Use the W2RG algorithm, 2 = Use the 5B4AZ algorithm.
Default is 1.</li>
<li>Pseudo-colorize images: Does some speculative colorization of
the combined pseudo-color image. 0 = no, 1 = yes. Default is 1 but
should be 0 if the Red channel is replaced by the Infra Red
channel.</li>
<li>Image APID's (channels) for Red, Green and Blue used for
combined pseudo-color image.</li>
<li>APIDs of images to invert their palette. This is normally
useful for the Infrared images were cold is dark and hot is white.
There should be three entries and 0 per place will disable this
option for the entry.</li>
<li>The range of values to which each channel image's luminance
will be mapped before combining into a color composite image. This
can be used to adjust the color balance of the composite
image.</li>
<li>The range of pixel values in the Blue image that will be
enhanced if Pseudo Colorization is enabled. This helps to improve
the color of watery areas (seas and lakes) since Normalization
darkens these areas by stretching the Histogram.</li>
<li>The directory to save received images in. If this is "Default"
then the default /home/&lt;user&gt;/mlrpt/images/ directory will be
used. Otherwise the specified directory will be used but please
note the the end / in the name is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Bugs" id="Bugs"><b>7. Bugs and annoyances:</b></a><br>
I have fixed whatever bugs I came across testing mlrpt but there
may be some hiding, waiting for the right conditions to appear.
This is a beta release so I would appreciate bug reports from any
users.</p>
<p><a name="Acknowledge" id="Acknowledge"><b>8.
Acknowledgments:</b></a><br>
This application was put together by modifying and adapting two
independent projects:<br>
The LRPT Demodulator is based and Davide Belloli's (dbdexter-dev)
"meteor_demod" project on <a href=
"https://github.com/dbdexter-dev/meteor_demod" target=
"_blank">GitHub</a>, and the LRPT Decoder is based on Artem
Litvinovich's (artlav) "meteor_decoder" project, also on <a href=
"https://github.com/artlav/meteor_decoder" target=
"_blank">GitHub</a>.<br>
My sincere thanks go to both developers for producing the
fundamental code needed to receive and decode LRPT images from the
Russian Meteor-M class weather satellites. And to the great ideal
of Free and Open Source software development model for enabling
this application to be built!</p>
<p>The Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
algorithm is based on code by Karel Zuiderveld, from "Graphics Gems
IV", Academic Press, 1994, Computer Vision Research Group, Utrecht,
The Netherlands</p>
<p>The built-in JPEG compressor code is based on the experimental
JPEG compressor Codename "Nether Poppleton" by Kornel Lesinski (c)
2013. All rights reserved. Based on code by Rich Geldreich. The
original was in C++ but I translated it to C as it is the
programming language I use.</p>
<p>The initial Image Rectification code was adapted from the
original "rectify-jpeg" tool produced by Rich Griffiths W2RG. Later
I added my own take on image rectification so the mlrpt has two
such functions for the user to choose from!</p>
<a name="Version" id="Version"><b>9. Version history:</b></a><br>
Please note that mlrpt was developed from mlrpt and so up to
version 0.7-beta it has the same version history:<br>
<b>Version 0.1-alpha:</b> Created the control code for the RTL-SDR
Receiver and the frame work to receive and filter streaming I/Q
samples.
<p><b>Version 0.2-alpha:</b> After editing and modification, I
incorporated the LRPT Demodulator code created by Davide Belloli
"debdexter-dev" and made it demodulate LRPT signals from the live
stream supplied by the SDR Receiver.<br></p>
<p><b>Version 0.3-alpha:</b> After editing and modification, I
incorporated the LRPT Decoder code created by Artem Litvinovich
"artlav" and made it decode images from the live streaming QPSK
soft symbols produced by the LRPT Demodulator.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.4-beta:</b> Once mlrpt was able to receive,
demodulate and decode LRPT images successfully, I considered it
ready for a beta status but did not release it as I was mainly
testing the graphical glrpt.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.5-beta:</b> Added built-in support for saving the
monochrome (Greyscale) channel images as JPEG files. The JPEG
compression code is open sourced and was released by Moodstocks
SAS. Copyright is owned by the company. Please note that if the
pseudo-color combined image creation is enabled, it can only be
saved as a PPM file.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.6-beta:</b> Fixed minor bugs in the code that saves
images in JPEG format.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.7-beta:</b> I have added the (slightly modified) C
code of the "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization"
algorithm by Karel Zuiderveld, from "Graphics Gems IV", Academic
Press, 1994, Computer Vision Research Group, Utrecht, The
Netherlands. This provides excellent regional enhancement of
contrast, but it has to follow my own simple Histogram
Normalization function, which is set up to leave behind the
occasional black stripes that Meteor-M2 seems to transmit in the
images.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.8-beta:</b> Fixed a buffer overrun bug in the
Histogram Normalization function reported by Coverity Scan.</p>
<p><b>Version 0.9-beta:</b> Fixed some minor bugs reported by
LLVM's clang-analyzer tool. Added options to the config file, to
specify for each channel image a range of values to which the
image's luminance will be mapped before combining into a color
composite image. This can be used to adjust the color balance of
the composite image. Also added options to specify the range of
pixel values in the Blue image that will enhanced if Pseudo
Colorization is enabled. This helps to improve the color of watery
areas (seas and lakes) since Normalization darkens these areas by
stretching the Histogram.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.0:</b> Added an new item in the
/home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration file, to specify
the directory to save received images in. I am removing the beta
since mlrpt has been tested by third parties and been debugged.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.1:</b> Added an new item in the
/home/user/mlrpt/&lt;config-file&gt; configuration file, to specify
the Blue channel pixels value above which it is assumed that they
are in a cloud area. This is used in the pseudo-colorize mode to
enhance cloud color.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.2:</b> Added support for the Airspy R2 and Mini SDR
receivers, using the native lib airspy driver API. Added a new
option in the mlrpt's configuration file to enable saving of images
as decoded from the satellite and without image processing
(Normalization and C.L.A.H.E. contrast enhancement). Modified data
transfer method to a double-buffered method to improve overall
performance. Added a new option in mlrpt's configuration file to
specify Manual Gain Control of the SDR Receiver, in the range
0-100%. Default is 90%. A value of 0 specifies Auto Gain
Control.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.3:</b> Modified the RRC Filter code to reduce
processor workload by about 5-6%. Not a very substantial result but
still worthwhile for lower-powered computers.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.4:</b> Fixed some bugs reported by Tim Kunze that
were preventing compilation, if one of the supported device drivers
(libairspy or librtlsdr) was not installed. Also replaced the
explicit_bzero() library function with memset() since the former
was not available in Tim Kunze's distribution (and possibly
others').<br>
Added an additional option in the mlrpt's configuration file to
specify the APID for an image channel to invert its palette, e.g.
change the luminance values from black-to-white into
white-to-black. This is useful for the Infra-red channel as clouds
(that are cold) are shown as black, and land that is warmer as
white</p>
<p><b>Version 1.4.1:</b> By user request, the acceptable receiver
filter bandwidth can now be between 100kHz and 200kHz.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.5:</b> Added code to rectify geometric distortion
in present in raw Meteor-M images. This code has been extracted and
adapted from the code of rectify-jpg, contributed by Rich Griffiths
W2RG.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6-beta:</b> With the arrival of a new Meteor-M2
satellite it is now necessary to have separate configuration files
for different satellites. mlrpt now requires one default
configuration file and one such for each satellite of interest. The
default file may be a link to one of the satellite-specific
files.</p>
<p>I have added my own take on rectifying Meteor-M raw images. The
code is similar to W2RG's code, except that the creation of added
pixels, needed to "stretch" the image, is done by linear
interpolation rather than filling gaps between pixels of the
rectified image. Either one of the rectification functions (or
none) can be specified in the configuration files or by a command
line option.</p>
<p>Davide Belloli (dbdexter-dev) has produced a new version of his
"meteor_demod" tool, a demodulator for Meteor M2 signals. This new
version now supports demodulation of both QPSK and OQPSK signals
and I have now incorporated it in mlrpt. Unfortunately artlav's
image decoder code "medet" does not support OQPSK, so mlrpt cannot
decode such signals (from Meteor M2 2 for example) at this time.
Hopefully some solution to the problem will be found sometime soon,
especially if artlav responds to such requests made on Github.</p>
<p>Artyom Litvinovich (artlav) has now produced a new version of
"medet" which supports decoding of OQPSK signals from Meteor M2-2,
in both 72k and 80k (interleaved) symbol rates. I have incorporated
the changes to mlrpt but have not yet been able to get the decoder
to work with the interleaved 80k symbol rate format. For this
reason I am releasing mlrpt, provisionally, as version 1.6-beta,
for testing.</p>
<p>I have managed to get the decoder to work with the 80k
Interleaved OQPSK mode but the code is still incomplete and results
in broken images. However, this is a hopeful sign for me, that I
may later manage to fix the adaptation of the original decoder.
Problem - Meteor M2-2 has switched to the 72k sym rate mode!
(Again).</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6.1-beta:</b> I made a number of changes to the
M2-2 80k symbol-rate demodulator and de-interleaver, to complete
the adaptation of artlav's meteor-decode (medet) tool. Yet again,
M2-2 changed to 72k mode just as I was ready to test mlrpt.
However, I was able to test it using pre-recorded raw I/Q data and
unfortunately the images produced are broken by wide black bands
and so far have not been able to find out why. I suspect the loss
of sync detection and if I can, I will try to do something about
it.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6.2-beta:</b> I fixed a bug in the code that
"fixes" the Differential Offset QPSK modulation scheme of Meteor
M2-2, which in rare circumstances could cause an off-by-one array
access, resulting in a segmentation fault.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6.2:</b> Meteor M2-2 now seems to be on the 72k
DOQPSK mode so I cannot do any more testing on the 80k Interleaved
mode. I have only made some changes to the installer, as described
earlier, and I am calling this my latest release version.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6.3:</b> Made some changes to the Costas PLL loop
to improve phase lock capture and stability.</p>
<p><b>Version 1.6.4:</b> After a report by Gianpi IK1TTD, I edited
the configuration files for the proper default SDR device (RTL-SDR)
and arranged for the mlrpt code to abnort on some configuration
errors.</p>
