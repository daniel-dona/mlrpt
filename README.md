# mlrpt
`mlrpt` is an application originally developed by [Neoklis Kyriazis](http://www.5b4az.org/). `mlrpt` is an universal receiver, demodulator and decoder of LRPT weather satellites images for Linux systems which works in console.

This fork is developed by Daniel Do√±a

## Requirements
### Hardware
This fork is ready to use RTL-SDR, if you want to use other hardware, use the main proyect as reference


## Installation

Just use the Docker image:

```docker run -it --device=/dev/bus/usb mlrpt:latest mlrpt -c /usr/local/share/mlrpt/examples/config/Meteor-M2.cfg```

If you want to limit even more the access of this application, you can specify the exact device you are using, for example:

```docker run -it --device=/dev/bus/usb/002/020 mlrpt:latest mlrpt -c /usr/local/share/mlrpt/examples/config/Meteor-M2.cfg```

On Linux use `lsusb` to find the device:

```Bus 002 Device 020: ID 0bda:2838 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL2838 DVB-T```

Now you're ready to use `mlrpt`.

## Usage

### Config files
`mlrpt` comes with a set of sample config files that are usually stored in `/usr/share/mlrpt/config`. `mlrpt`'s config files use [libconfig](http://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/) syntax. Example config files are well-documented so consult them for details.

You can specify config file with command-line option or store default one as `$HOME/.mlrptrc`.

Maximum length of string parameters in config files is limited to the 80 characters. Please use ASCII symbols only in strings! Also there are a bunch of mandatory options that should be presented in config files. They are listed below.

#### SDR receiver frequency (kHz)
Option name: `freq`; option group: `receiver`; valid values: `136000 <= freq <= 138000`.

#### QPSK modulation mode
Option name: `mode`; option group: `demodulator`; valid values: `"QPSK", "DOQPSK", "IDOQPSK"`.

#### QPSK transmission symbol rate (Sym/s)
Option name: `rate`; option group: `demodulator`; valid values: `50000 <= rate <= 100000`.

#### Active APIDs
Option name: `apids`; option group: `decoder`; valid values: `[64-69, 64-69, 64-69]`.

All missing/invalid optional settings will be set to their defaults. So minimal working configuration would be like that (Meteor-M2 example):
```
receiver: {
        freq = 137100
}

demodulator: {
        mode = "QPSK"
            rate = "72000"
}

decoder: {
        apids = [66, 65, 64]
}
```

### Command-line options

#### `-c <config-file>`
Specify which configuration file to use.

#### `-s <HHMM-HHMM>`
Start and stop operation time in HHMM format.

#### `-q`
Run in quiet mode (no messages printed).

#### `-i`
Flip images (useful for South to North passes).

#### `-h`
Print usage information and exit.

#### `-v`
Print version information and exit.

### Decoding images
Use [GPredict](https://github.com/csete/gpredict) to get pass time list for the satellite of interest. Connect your SDR receiver and run `mlrpt`. Wait until satellite rises over the horizon - PLL should lock after some time. When the flight is over or you decided to stop just close `mlrpt`. Decoded images will be saved into `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mlrpt` (or in `$HOME/.cache/mlrpt` if `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is not set).

## Troubleshooting

### `mlrpt` fails to initialize device
`mlrpt` requires connected SDR before starting up. Connect your receiver and restart `mlrpt`.

### PLL never locks
Try to play with gain settings in config file and find reasonable value to get highest SNR. Also you can try to increase filter bandwidth to somewhat higher value such as 140 kHz. One more thing you could try is to increase PLL lock threshold.

### Poor signal quality
Be sure to properly install your antenna. [V-dipole](https://lna4all.blogspot.com/2017/02/diy-137-mhz-wx-sat-v-dipole-antenna.html) setup in contrast with traditional QFH and turnstile gives you extra advantage that terrestrial broadcasting will be attenuated by ~20 dB. You can try also to switch to manual gain setting and reduce it until you get decent SNR.

### My images are rotated upside-down!
If you've decoded South-to-North satellite pass you will end up with inverted image. Use invert feature that `mlrpt` provides.
