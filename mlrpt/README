This version of "mlrpt" can use any one of the configuration files in this
directory. This is done by using the -c option: "mlrpt -c M2-2-72k.cfg" will
make mlrpt use the config file for Meteor M2-2 in the 72k non-interleaved
Differential OQPSK mode. If no -c option is used, mlrpt will use whatever
file is linked to the default.cfg symlink.

The config files in this directory are set up for the current frequencies
and modes of Meteor M2-1 and Meteor M2-2 satellites. M2-2 keeps changing
both while it is still in the commissioning stage. Please edit these config
files according to the current status of these satellites.

Also, the "images" directory can be a symlink to some other directory in a
different place in the file system. Make "images" a relative symbolic link
to this other directory, if you like.
